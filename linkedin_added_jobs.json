    "job_description": "JOB DESCRIPTION BackgroundThe Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC) is a flagship project of the Government of Bangladesh that has established a nationally recognized model for locally led climate adaptation by channeling climate finance to Local Government Institutions (LGIs) and vulnerable communities through innovative, low-transaction-cost mechanisms. LoGIC will promote local action on climate change adaptation at scale through its’ Initiation Plan (IP) for phase-II. The Initiation Plan (IP) for Scaling the Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC) will be implemented over a 12-month period as a preparatory phase designed to bridge the gap between the completion of LoGIC I and the development, approval, and launch of LoGIC II. This phase aims to lay the groundwork for the full-scale roll-out of LoGIC II by providing targeted support to the Local Government Division (LGD) and technical assistance to the Economic Relations Division (ERD).The IP will facilitate the national scaling of the LoGIC model by supporting LGD in institutionalizing the approach, while enabling ERD to initiate and complete critical technical studies, including cost-benefit analyses, feasibility studies, and the development of financing tools and models. It will also ensure the systematic capture of lessons learned and help establish the operational, financial, and institutional foundations required for a sustainable, government-led, and financially viable LoGIC II.During this phase, the project will provide technical, operational, and policy support for preparing and securing funding for the Development Project Proposal (DPP) and the Project Document (ProDoc) for LoGIC II. It will further support the design of a blended finance model; strengthen institutional memory; promote community engagement; and conduct feasibility assessments related to Nature-based Solutions (NbS), community resilience, and private sector partnerships. Additional efforts will focus on developing models that link vulnerable communities to value chains, and on enhancing institutional, legal, and policy frameworks for improved service delivery and long-term sustainability.The IP will adopt an adaptive management approach to minimize the impact of political transitions on the initiation of LoGIC II. This will include maintaining flexibility to scale the project with a combination of loans and grants as planned, or to proceed with the Government of Bangladesh’s committed funds alongside development partners’ grants.Within this context, the Green Business and Innovation Associate will play a critical role in supporting the design, analysis, and coordination of green business, innovation, and value-chain components during the IP phase, ensuring that LoGIC II is ready for rapid, cost-effective, and impactful rollout at national scale.The Admin and Finance Associate will be responsible for preparing, managing and expenditure of project annual and multi-year budget, managing audit, preparation of financial report and compliance related to financial issues as per government and UNDP policies and procedure.Duties And Responsibilitiesi.

Promoting the rights of every child is not just a job – it is a calling.UNICEF is a place where careers are built: we offer our staff diverse opportunities for professional and personal development that will help them reinforce a sense of purpose while serving children and communities across the world. We welcome everyone who wants to belong and grow in a diverse and passionate culture, coupled with an attractive compensation and benefits package.Visit our website to learn more about what we do at UNICEF.For every child, the right to education,The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the Organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions — her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens — addressing inequity — not only will give more children the opportunity to fulfill their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries. This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also supporting the equitable development of nations.How can you make a difference?Purpose Of The JobUnder the supervision of the Chief, Field Office and technical guidance of Chief of Education/Education Manager, the Education Officer (NOB) provides technical, operational, and coordination support to the planning, implementation, monitoring, and reporting of UNICEF-supported education programmes and projects in collaboration with government counterparts and implementing partners.
